<h1> How I made my Ornithopter </h1>
            <p>My <i>Ornithopter</i> was a mix between a gyrocopter and a spinning plane and worked in a very awkward way.</p>

<h2> How did I make the rotor turn? </h2>
            <p>First I had to make my rotor wing the size of my gyrocopter to get it to float correctly. Next was the creation of the spinnning motion, which needed just the right amount of rubber bands and wielding with hot glue and paper clips. The torque was a problem but in the end it work out in a new and interesting way.
<h3>Future Updates</h3>
<p>I am currently thinking about how to make the spinning less eradict and more controled to keep it ballanced and flying in a straight line.</p>
