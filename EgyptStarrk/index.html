    <h1>Beginning the Ornithopter</h1>
    <p> An ornithoper is a device that replicates the flying motion of a bird. The objective of creating the the ornithoper was to make it fly and glide in the air for as long as possible. So, I decided to use materials such as bosa wood and straws for a very light frame, and plastic bag material for the wings. It was important to first draw out a sketch of the ornithopter so one could have an idea on where to begin. After learning about the Four forces pulling on bird's wings while they fly, I thought it would be a good idea to increase the force,weight, in the front of my ornithopter in order to provide more control in the air, rather than creating an irregular motion when flying.</p>

    <h2> The Frustration when creating the Ornithoper </h2>
    <p>The most challenging component of creating the ornithopter was making the rubber band motor,crank and structure of the wings all move in unison. It is a pretty difficult and frustrating task to complete without having total knowlege of physics, but just creating an idea from your mind to something tangibal is a rather difficuilt process. Although difficult, the task can be completed. At the end, all your hardwork will pay off, and it's nice to see your creation displayed right infront of you. My ornithopter is still a work in progress. I can't wait to see the final product!!</p>
