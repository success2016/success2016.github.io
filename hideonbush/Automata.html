    <h1>Kamehameha</h1>
    <p>I made an automata in the form of Goku that performs a human action. Goku is a saiyan, a super-human who has unusual powers. My Goku will perform a "Kamehameha", an action where he charges up a ball of power and then fires it at an enemy.

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I encountered many problems during the first day of building. I created a prototype of the body, but it did not have a long enough arm to reach the other side. The mechanism to move Goku's arms and legs was also difficult to think of. The only problem with the final product is that it lacks the connection between the top of the rod and the figure itself. This hinders it from actually moving its arms.
