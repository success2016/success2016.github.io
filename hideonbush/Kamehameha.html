    <h1>My Automata</h1>

    <p>I am in the process of making an automata that performs a human action.</p>

    <h2>Goku</h2>

    <p>Goku is a saiyan, a super-human who has unusual powers.</p>

    <h3>Action</h3>

    <p>My Goku will perform a "Kamehameha", an action where he charges up a ball of power and then fires it at an enemy.</p>

    <h4>Problems: Day 1</h4>

    <p>I encountered many problems during the first day of building. I created a prototype of the body, but it did not have a long enough arm to reach the other side.
       The mechanism to move Goku's arms and legs was also difficult to think of.</p>

    <h5>Problems: Day 2</h5>

    <p>During my second day of building, I created the mechanism to move Goku's arms         and legs. A rod was stuck through a side of a box and ended with a gear in the     middle of the space. A copper wire was stuck through the rod, and a thin vertical     rod was stuck through the wire. This thin rod went up through the top of the box,     and will be attached to a string that is attached to the arms of Goku. Thinking of     the idea of the wire and holes required to let the vertical rod move freely was a     minor problem. Also, placing the different pieces in the correct ways and places     was essential to having a working mechanism.</p>

    <p>This is a picture of an automata that includes a human making a rowing motion. There is a mechanism below that creates the movement after the crank is turned.</p>
