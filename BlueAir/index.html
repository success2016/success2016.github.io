    <h2><u><b>My project</b></u></h2>
   <p>To build a workable ornithopther.</p>
    <h3><u>My steps</u></h3>
    <p> First: In my mind and my notebook, I came up with idea of how it fly,how it look and how it was build.<br>Second: Grab the material and start building</p>
    <h3><b>My Challenge</b></h3>
    <p>My challenge was to make a mechanism that flaping the wings and finding and making a stable, light wing. I have to use pliers to bend the metal as straght as possible. As for my wings, I find very light wings and cut it in the way half-circle and strenghten it by straw.</p></div>
