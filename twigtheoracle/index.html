        <h1>Shock Absorbing Crutch for Reduced Stress on Arm </h1>
        <p>Often, using crutches for prolonged periods of time can cause stress upon the arm and especailly upon the armpit. The goal of my weeklong project is to create an improved version of the crutch with a shock absorbing foot, reducing stress upon the arm.</p>
        <p>The construction of a crutch is reliativly simple, so the main problem is how to mount a shock absorbing device to the bottom of the crutch. There are a few problems associated with this:</p>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>How to ensure that the shock absorbing device is firmly mounted to the crutch and will not break under the repeated stress of walking</li>
            <li>How to ensure that the cantilevered "foot" of the crutch will not bend or break under the angle and force that it is under</li>
            <li>How to ensure that the "foot" of the crutch has enough grip to ensure that it would not slip</li>
            <li>How to make the resistance and dampening of the shock absorbing device such that it is either adjustible or at a confortable level for all people</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The solutions to these four problems are as following:</p>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li><p>To ensure that the shock absorbing device is firmly mounted, the main body of the device was mounted inside the bottom of the crutch. Although not a snug fit, the device is secured throught the usage of dead bolts which ensure it wil not fall out</p><p>To ensure the device will not break under the repeated stress of walking, materials should be considered. In addition, the next point greatly decreases risk of failure.</p></li>
            <li>
                To address the cantilevered "foot" of the crutch, some ideas and definitions must be explained first:
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>A cantilever, or a cantilevered shaft, is a rod only supported on one side. This is dangerous because any force exerted on the shaft will torque it, greatly increasing risk of failrue</li>
                    <li>Torque is the angular equivalent of Force. It is calculated by the formula τ =  or τ = I x [alpha]. As the radius increases, so does the angular acceleration and thus the force on the rod</li>
                </ul>
                In other words, the way to minimize the risk due to cantilevered shafts is to minimze the radius. To do this we made the "arm" of the "foot" as small as possible, reducing the maximum radius.
            </li>
            <li>To ensure that the foot of the crutch has enough grip so as to not slip on surfaces ranging from smooth tile to carpet, we attatched half of a inside out tennis ball, which is very grippy, to the end of the crutch</li>
            <li>Unfourtunatly, we did not have the time nor the resources to make adjustible shock absortion, so we set it at a level that should be confortable for everyone.</li>
        </ol>
