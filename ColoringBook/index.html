            <h1>The Creation of My Ornithopter</h1>
            <p1>An ornithopter is a fly mechanism that flaps its wings in order to fly. Ornithopter's were some of the first flying devices.</p1>
            <h2>How I decided to make my ornithopter</h2>
            <p>In order to create my ornithopter, I used wood, phonebook paper, wire and rubber bands. With these materials, i was able to build a medium sized ornithopter.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> While buliding my ornithopter, I encoutered a couple of porblems. My biggest challenge was creating the crank that would perpell the wings of the mechanizm. My first crank was flawed because the wings would flap at different rates, which would cause the ornithopter to fly to the left or right, and ultimalty would cause the ornithopter to crash. After doing some research, I realized how I could creat another crank that allows the wings to flap at an eqaul rate. This crank was V shaped, but also an L shape on the back. Through trail and error, I was to prefect the crank.  </p>
