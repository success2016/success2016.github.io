            <h1>The Creation of My Ornithopter</h1>
            <p>An ornithopter is a fly mechanism that flaps its wings in order to fly. Ornithopter's were some of the first flying devices.</p>

            <h2>How I decided to make my ornithopter</h2>
            <p>To bulid an ornithopter, we were only give everyday materials like popsicle sticks, hot glue, and more to use. Intially, I sketeched out different designs to choose from before building. This allowed me to get all my ideas on paper. When I finished brainstroming, I began building. In order to create my ornithopter, I used wood, phonebook paper, wire and rubber bands. With these materials, I was able to build a toy size ornithopter.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> While buliding my ornithopter, I encoutered a couple of porblems. My biggest challenge was creating the crank that would perpell the wings of the mechanizm. My first crank was flawed because the wings would flap at different rates, which would cause the ornithopter to fly to the left or right, and ultimalty would cause the ornithopter to crash. After doing some research, I realized how I could creat another crank that allows the wings to flap at an eqaul rate. This crank was V shaped, but also an L shape on the back. Through trail and error, I was to prefect the crank.  </p>
