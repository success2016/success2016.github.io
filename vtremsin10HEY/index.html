	<p>Ornithopter is a machine designed to achieve flight by means of flapping wings. It flies through the skies like a bird, and does not use the force of lift the same way as airplanes. Ornithopters are a good way to learn the physics of flight and engineer a nice 			project</p>

	<p>The most major problem that I faced was the fact that I ran out of time on my build. I couldn't really engineer the wings too well in the time that I had.</p>
