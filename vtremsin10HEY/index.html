	<h2>What is an ornithopter?</h2>
	<p>Ornithopter is a machine designed to achieve flight by means of flapping wings. It flies through the skies like a bird, and does not use the force of lift the same way as airplanes. Ornithopters are a good way to learn the physics of flight and engineer a nice project in a short amount of time.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I overcome?</h2>
	<p>The most major problem that I faced was the fact that I ran out of time on my build. I couldn't really engineer the wings too well in the time that I had. This is why in the end I only had a bare-bone ornithopter that could not fly.</p>
