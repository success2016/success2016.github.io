    <h1 style align="center">My Project</h1>
    <p></p>My project is to make a tool that can assist humans, where it can include accesories and attachments made to make moving and doing simple tasks much much easier. My project is an arm attachment designed to enhance the potency of one's punches. The picture next to this text, is a rough model of what it is supposed to look like. It is supposed to extend a bar used for enhancing punching power with the use of hydraulics and pneumatics.</p>

    <p>One particularly tricky challenge I had faced while making the arm was the fact that I had to make it fit my forearm and my hand in order for me to use it as an attachment. A soltuion to this problem was to use thin cardboard straps attached to the bottom of my project in order to tightly secure the arm in the contraception.<i> Now it's operational and ready to be used.</i></p>

  <h2> Now we get to our feature presentation. Boxes.</h2>

   <h1 style align="center">Origins</h1>
    <p>Many generations ago, a new civilization was born into the cruel word of Earth. A primitive civilization, just starting to develop, already is threatened by the many natives roaming these lands. However, utilizing their impressive inner mechanical bodies, they survive by pure movement, escaping danger that turns any corner. Today they are now a delicate race located in unreachable positions.</p>
    <h2 align="center">How They Work</h2>
    <p>Box people are purely mechanical on the inside and on the outside, using gears and cams in order to strictly move their arms and legs in specific ways to provide movement for their whole bodies. They're greatest strength is their resilience, being able to take many hits and being able to survive in a variety of harsh and cruel habitats.</p>

    <h2>Where They're Located</h2>
    <p>Boxes are known to be living in hazardous and desolate places. Places can include Box Land, Butt Mountains, and Cardboard Cuttery. Attempting to traverse these areas is not recommended at all. If you want to hunt these box creatures, expect to put in a lot of work.</p>

    <p>Their habitats are dangerous places.</p>
