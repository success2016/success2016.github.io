    <h1>Ornithopter: Take One</h1>
    <p>First desgined by Leonardo da Vinci, the ornithopter is a mechanical device that, like a bird, flaps its wings to gain lift. It is generally self propelling and utilizes various mechanics to ultimately achieve "flight".</p>

    <h2>Engineering A Prototype</h2>
    <p>Using common materials like wood, plastic, hot glue, etc., we attempted to design and construct our own self-flying machines. While the classic ornithopter has a crankshaft that alternates rotating clavicle pieces to flap the "wings", I chose a simpler design with a rotational wheel piece that responds with the flapping clavicle movements.</p>
    <p>At first, making sure that the clavicle pieces rotated enough so that they resulted in the correct wing movement was the most difficult challenge. While I had first used a rotating wheel piece with two pivot points that connected to the clavicles, I realized through trial and error that having two pivot points would always result in at least one obstructing the other when the wheel was rotating, therefore hindering the resulting wing movements.</p>
    <p>To resolve this, I created one pivot point on the wheel with both clavicle pieces overlapping one said point; that way, when the wheel rotated, both clavicle pieces could be rotated equally.</p>
    <h2>Ornithopter 2.0</h2>
    <p>After my first attempt at designing my own ornithopter, I found certain key issues. For one, substituting the traditional crankshaft with a wheel, while efficient, resulted in certain missalignment of the clavicle pieces. Due to a failure in accurately balancing the clavacle pieces, the wing movement was lopsided compared to the desired "flapping" effect. To make sure that the wheel mechanism worked in future prototypes, I would make sure to adjust the length of the pieces so that on the rotation, the clavicle pieces would be long enough to create a lesser lopsided effect.</p>
