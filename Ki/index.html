    <h1>Ornithopter: Take One</h1>
    <p>First desgined by Leonardo da Vinci, the ornithopter is a mechanical device that, like a bird, flaps its wings to gain lift. It is generally self propelling and utilizes various mechanics to ultimately achieve "flight".</p>

    <h2>Engineering A Prototype</h2>
    <p>Using common materials like wood, plastic, hot glue, etc., we attempted to design and construct our own self-flying machines. While the classic ornithopter has a crankshaft that alternates rotating clavicle pieces to flap the "wings", I chose a simpler design with a rotational wheel piece that responds with the flapping clavicle movements.</p>
