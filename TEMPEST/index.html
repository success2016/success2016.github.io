    <p>An ornithopter is a mechanical device that has wings powered by rubberbands, helping it fly. An ornithopter is typically made of wood, but can also be made of plastic. It is usually made of a light material, which helps it fly better. I had to look at pictures of other ornithopters and also had to draw my ideas in my notebook to form a solid plan for this project. I used light pieces of wood to make the frame of the ornithopter, while using straws for the frame of the wings and tail wing. I used wire to make the crank shaft, which was very hard to create. After I finished building it, I had to also test if the ornithopter could actually fly. </p>

    <div>Making the Crankshaft</div>
   
    <p>The crankshaft was the hardest part to make out of the whole ornithopter. The crank shaft was hard to design because I had to design it so the wings would flap symmetrically and not at the wrong times. I made the crank shaft out of popsicle sticks and drew a wire through the popsicle sticks to form the actual crank that you spin. It took a few tries and a LOT of popsicle sticks, but I finally made it work by bending the wire in a way so when you crank it, the wings move symmetrically.</p>
