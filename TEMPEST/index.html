    <h1>How I Made An Ornithopter</h1>
    <p>An ornithopter is a mechanical device that has wings powered by rubberbands, helping it fly. An ornithopter is typically made of wood, but can also be made of plastic. It is usually made of a light material, which helps it fly better. I had to look at pictures of other ornithopters and also had to draw my ideas in my notebook to form a solid plan for this project. I used light pieces of wood to make the frame of the ornithopter, while using straws for the frame of the wings and tail wing. I used wire to make the crank shaft, which was very hard to create. After I finished building it, I had to also test if the ornithopter could actually fly. </p>
