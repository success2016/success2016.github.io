# Goals for Today
* Push your website online
* Finish your article and pass the [w3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* BONUS: start checking out CSS

# How to get your website hosted
* Create your own folder in the `website` folder
* Folder must be titled with your username - which cannot be your actual name
  * username must consist only of numbers and letters, no spaces
  * `snumas` works for Scott Numamoto, but `scottn` doesn't
* Within your folder, title your file `index.html`
  * Having the correct extension, `.html` is important
* With this done, I'll push your changes to the website every night or so

# How to visit your website online
* Once you've completed the above steps and waited a day, go to `http://success2016.github.io/yourusername`

### Why is my website not online / updated?
* Make sure your page doesn't contain your name or anybody else's name
* Make sure any pictures you include don't include anybody else's face
* Make sure all your files are live in the shared Google Drive folder
* I'll check and push changes to the website at night a few times a week. I may not have yet pushed up changes.

# What should my current website contain?
* Create an article about one of the projects we've done
* Include a description of the project (3-5 sentences)
  * What's an ornithopter
  * What're some uses
  * Where might somebody typically see an ornithopter
* Include a problem you faced (3-5 sentences)
  * How I figured out that my joints weren't working
  * If I had more time, I would've done this differently since...
  * Turns out, using this type of wood was far better than this other material because...
* Include a photo and hyperlink
  * Can be a photo you took or one from the web
  * Hyperlink can be to more information about ornithopters

### Get your website checked

* To get feedback on your website, use the [w3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* You can copy and paste your code into textbox under the `Validate by Direct Input` tab
* Ask for help if you need help decoding the warning and error messages
* Try to pass all the checks!
