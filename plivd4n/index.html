	<h1>Ornithopter Design and Creation</h1>

	<h3>What is an Ornithopter?</h3>
	<p> Ornithopters are machines designed to replicate the flight of birds. It utilizes a crank to move a shaft to power its wings.</p>
	<h3>How I made my ornithopter</h3>
	<p>I first produced the framing for my ornithopter using lightweight balsa wood. I then made the crank mechanism by bending a paperclip into an u-shape to let the wings flap. I then attached the arms allowing the wings to flap with the rotating crank. After finisnhing the crank, I then moved onto creating the wings. I made the braces for the wings from plywood then made the actual wing out of a very light paper. They were designed to assist the ornithopter in gliding down to the floor. The tail for the ornithopter was made with the same type of paper.   </p>

	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<p>While creating the ornithopter I had very few challenges. Origional crank mechanism that I created had a large friction problem and was unable to rotate freely. I solved this by adding beads on the crank. to minimise contact with the hot glue. </p>
